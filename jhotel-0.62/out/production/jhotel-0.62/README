JHotel is a software for small and medium-sized hotels. It has everything that
these kind of hotels require:

- Guest management
- Reservation management
- Checkin management
- Statistics

JHotel is available under the GNU General Public License which is provided
with JHotel and can be found in the COPYING file. JHotel can be downloaded
for free from Sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jhotel

JHotel is written in Java and will run everywhere, where there's a JavaVM 
available.



Installation
============
In order to install JHotel, simply download either the .zip or the .gz or
the .bz2 file and extract it.
Of course you can also download the source (.src.zip, .src.gz or .src.bz2)
and compile JHotel yourself using javac (or any other Java compiler).



Running JHotel
==============
Given that JHotel is Java software, there are no executable files. In order
to run it, you need to install a JavaVM, see http://java.sun.com for
details and downloads.



Microsoft Windows:
------------------

- Either open the command prompt, cd to the directory where JHotel is installed
  and type: java -jar JHotel.jar
  The filename may vary depending on the version of JHotel.
- Or simply double-click the .jar file


Linux/Unix:
-----------

Open a terminal, cd to the directory where JHotel is installed and type:
			    
		java -jar JHotel.jar

The filename may vary depending on the version of JHotel.
You can also run the file jhotel which is a bash script and does exactly
the above.


Mac OS 9/X:
-----------

Make sure you have the Apple JavaVM installed and simply double-click the .jar
file. In Mac OS X you can also go the Unix way.
